FramedL exemplifies the convergence of social media, blockchain, and developer freedom:

User-Centric Design: Users interact with apps in-feed, removing the need for external dapps or wallet connectors.
Developer Empowerment: Builders can ship apps fast, iterate quickly, and reach users directly through Farcasterâ€™s viral social graph.
Onchain Utility: From NFT drops to DAO voting, FramedL and similar apps unlock new use cases for decentralized communities.
