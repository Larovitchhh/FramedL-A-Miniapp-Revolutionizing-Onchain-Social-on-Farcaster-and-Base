FramedL: A Miniapp Revolutionizing Onchain Social on Farcaster and Base
FramedL is a miniapp channel on Farcaster, a decentralized social protocol built on Ethereum. It represents a new wave of interactive, in-feed applications known as Mini Apps—formerly called Frames—that allow users to engage with full-fledged web apps directly within their social feed.
FramedL leverages this capability to deliver dynamic, onchain experiences without requiring users to leave the Farcaster ecosystem. Whether it's minting NFTs, playing games, or interacting with DeFi tools, FramedL showcases how social and blockchain can merge seamlessly.
