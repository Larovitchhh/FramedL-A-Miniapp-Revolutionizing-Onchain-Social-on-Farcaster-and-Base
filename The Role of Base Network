Base, an Ethereum Layer 2 developed by Coinbase, plays a crucial role in powering Farcaster Mini Apps like FramedL:

Optimized for Onchain Social: Base provides fast, low-cost transactions ideal for social-native apps.
MiniKit SDK: Base offers the MiniKit, a developer toolkit that simplifies building Mini Apps with wallet abstraction, React hooks, and seamless integration with Farcaster clients. [docs.base.org]
Cross-Client Compatibility: Apps built with MiniKit work across Farcaster, Base App, and other clients, ensuring consistent behavior and user experience.

FramedL benefits from this infrastructure by enabling frictionless onchain interactions embedded directly in social posts.
